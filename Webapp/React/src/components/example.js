            <p style={{margin:"0"}}>I find it very intriguing that Lee Radziwill, Jackie Kennedy's sister and the cousin of these women, would encourage the Maysles' to make "Big Edie" and 
              "Little Edie" the subject of a film. They certainly could be considered the "skeletons" in the family closet. The extra features on the DVD include several 
              contemporary fashion designers crediting some of their ideas to these oddball women. I'd say that anyone interested in fashion would find the discussion by these 
              designers fascinating. (i.e. "Are they nuts? Or am I missing something?"). 
              This movie is hard to come by. Netflix does not have it. Facets does, though.</p>

            <p style={{margin:"0"}}>Encouraged by the positive comments about this film on here I was looking forward to watching this film. Bad mistake. I've seen 950+ films and this is 
              truly one of the worst of them - it's awful in almost every way: editing, pacing, storyline, 'acting,' soundtrack (the film's only song - a lame country 
              tune - is played no less than four times). The film looks cheap and nasty and is boring in the extreme. Rarely have I been so happy to see the end credits
               of a film. The only thing that prevents me giving this a 1-score is Harvey Keitel - while this is far from his best performance he at least 
               seems to be making a bit of an effort. One for Keitel obsessives only.</p>

            <h4 style={{marginBottom:"0"}}>Example 4</h4>
            <p style={{margin:"0"}}>I saw this movie when I was about 12 when it came out. I recall the scariest scene was the big bird eating men dangling helplessly from parachutes 
              right out of the air. The horror. The horror.As a young kid going to these cheesy B films on Saturday afternoons, I still was tired of the 
              formula for these monster type movies that usually included the hero, a beautiful woman who might be the daughter of a professor and a happy resolution 
              when the monster died in the end. I didn't care much for the romantic angle as a 12 year old and the predictable plots. I love them now for the 
              unintentional humor.But, about a year or so later, I saw Psycho when it came out and I loved that the star, Janet Leigh, was bumped off 
              early in the film. I sat up and took notice at that point. Since screenwriters are making up the story, make it up to be as scary as possible and not 
              from a well-worn formula. There are no rules.</p>
